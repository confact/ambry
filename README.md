# Prequel

Prequel is a database and ORM replacement for small, mostly static models. Use
it to replace database-persisted seed data and ad-hoc structures in your app or
library with plain old Ruby objects that are searchable via a fast, simple
database-like API.

It implements Active Model and has generators to integrate nicely with Rails.

For more info, take a peek at the {Guide}, or read on for some quick samples.

## A quick tour

    # Create a model.
    class Country
      # Turn any Ruby object into a Prequel model by extending this module.
      extend Prequel::Model

      # The first field listed here will be the "primary key."
      field :tld, :name

      # Chainable filters, sort of like Active Record scopes.
      filters do
        def big
          find {|c| c.population > 100_000_000}
        end

        def in_region(region)
          find {|c| c.region == region)
        end
      end

      # Root filter, can be used to setup relations.
      def regions
        Region.find {|r| r.id == region}
      end

    end

    # create some contries
    Country.create :tld => "AR", :name => "Argentina", :region => :america, :population => 40_000_000
    Country.create :tld => "CA", :name => "Canada",    :region => :america, :population => 34_000_000
    Country.create :tld => "JP", :name => "Japan",     :region => :asia,    :population => 127_000_000
    Country.create :tld => "CN", :name => "China",     :region => :asia,    :population => 1_300_000_000

    # Save the database. Prequel is oriented towards reads, so you only write
    # when you want to save the whole database.
    adapter.save_database

    # Do some searches
    big_asian_countries = Country.big.in_region(:asia)
    start_with_c        = Country.find {|c| c.name =~ /^C/}

A guide for Prequel is in the works, but for now you can read the API docs.


## Installation

    gem install prequel

## Compatibility

Prequel has been tested against these current Rubies, and is likely compatible
with others. Note that 1.8.6 is not supported.

* Ruby 1.8.7 - 1.9.2
* Rubinius 1.2.3
* JRuby 1.5.6

## Thanks

Thanks to Adri√°n Mugnolo for ideas, code review and the idea for the name.
Thanks to the authors of [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org/) for the
inspiration for this library's name, and the the idea behind how the filters and
relations should work.
