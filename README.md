# Prequel

Prequel is a database and ORM replacement for small, mostly static models. In
many applications, you need models for datasets like the 50 US states, the
world's countries with associated TLDs, or categories of products a business
sells.

Creating a model with Active Record, DataMapper or another ORM and storing this
data in an RDBMS is often overkill, especially if you don't need to update the
data frequently. On the other hand, storing that data in a Hash constant offers
little flexibility when it comes to filtering the data, or establishing
relations with models for things like users or invoices that do belong in a
database.

Prequel offers a middle ground: it makes use of Ruby's Enumerable module to
expose a powerful, ORM-like query interface to Ruby's Hash, and allows you to
persist your model data in a file.

Prequel loads your dataset from the file and keeps it in memory. It's not a
"NoSQL", it's a "NoDB". There's not only no schema or migrations to set up,
there's also no server or anything else to install since its only dependencies are
Ruby's standard library. It was inspired in part by
[Rubinius's](http://rubini.us/) short but meaningful tagline "Use Ruby."

But just a word of warning - don't even dare think about using it for more than
a couple megabytes of data. For that you need a real database of some sort, like
Postgres, MySQL, Redis, Mongo, etc.

## A Brief Example

### Setup

Initialize Prequel by instantiating an adapter. For Rails, this could go in a
`config/initializers/prequel.rb`.

    require "prequel/adapters/yaml"
    Prequel::Adapters::YAML.new(Rails.root.join("db", "prequel.yaml")

Setting up a class with PrequelModel is simple: just extend the module, and
declare your persistable fields with `attr_accessor`. The first field declared
will be behave as the "primary key," and it's up to you to ensure that it's
unique.

    class Person
      extend Prequel::Model
      attr_accessor :name, :email
    end


Build your "database" in a seed script and then treat Prequel models as
read-only in your application.

    Person.create :name => "Moe Howard", :email => "moe@3stooges.com"
    Person.create :name => "Larry Fine", :email => "larry@3stooges.com"
    adapter.save_database

If you're using YAML, you could also just edit the "database" directly, though a
seed script offers more ease of use, and flexibility if you later decide to
convert your models to another ORM.

    ---
    Person:
      moe@3stooges.com:
          :name: Moe Howard
          :email: moe@3stooges.com
      shemp@3stooges.com:
          :name: Shemp Howard
          :email: shemp@3stooges.com
      curly@3stooges.com:
          :name: Curly Howard
          :email: curly@3stooges.com
      larry@3stooges.com:
          :name: Larry Fine
          :email: larry@3stooges.com
      curlyjoe@3stooges.com:
          :name: Joe DeRita
          :email: curlyjoe@3stooges.com

### Querying

You can get a model instance by key with the `get` method:

    @moe = Person.get "moe@3stooges.com"

Searching and sorting are done via blocks. This is very fast for the small
datasets that Prequel is designed for. You can treat the block argument
similarly to an OpenStruct, accessing attributes as symbols, strings or method
names.

    @larry = Person.first {|p| p[:name] =~ /Larry/}
    @curly = Person.first {|p| p.email =~ /curly/ && p.name =~ /Howard/}

Perhaps counterintuitively, the results of finds are not arrays of instances,
but rather sets of keys:

    # This will be an instance of Prequel::KeySet
    @stooges = Person.find {|p| p["email"] =~ /stooge/}

    # This will be an array of Person instances
    @stooges = Person.find {|p| p["email"] =~ /stooge/}.instances

    # Iterate via instances
    Person.find {|p| p["email"] =~ /stooge/}.each_instance do |stooge|
      p stooge.name
    end

This makes Prequel fast by avoiding the creation of unused instances, and lets
you create chainable filters via model class methods:

    class Country
      extend Prequel::Model
      attr_accessor :tld, :name, :population, :region
      use :main

      def self.african
        find {|p| p.region == :africa}
      end

      def self.european
        find {|p| p.region == :europe}
      end

      def self.population(op, num)
        find {|p| p.population.send(op, num)}.sort {|a, b| b.population <=> a.population}
      end
    end

    african_countries              = Country.african
    bigger_countries               = Country.population(:>=, 50_000_000)
    smaller_countries              = Country.population(:<=, 5_000_000)
    european_countries             = Country.european
    bigger_african_countries       = Country.african.population(:>=, 50_000_000)

It also lets you do set operations on the key sets themselves:

    bigger_non_african_countries   = bigger_countries  - african_countries
    bigger_or_european_countries   = bigger_countries  | european_countries
    smaller_and_european_countries = smaller_countries + european_countries
    smaller_european_countries     = smaller_countries & european_countries


### Active Model

Prequel has full Active Model support. Simply include `Prequel::ActiveModel` to
make your model behave like Active Record.

    class Country
      extend Prequel::Model
      include Prequel::ActiveModel

      use :main

      attr_accessor :tld, :name, :population

      validates_presence_of :name
      validates_numericality_of :population
      validates_uniqueness_of :tld, :slug

      before_save :set_slug

      # Use Babosa for slugging - http://github.com/norman/babosa
      def set_slug
        @slug = name.to_slug.normalize.to_s
      end

      alias to_param slug
    end

## Installation

    gem install prequel

## Compatibility

Prequel has been tested against these current Rubies, and is likely compatible
with others. Note that 1.8.6 is not supported.

* Ruby 1.8.7 - 1.9.2
* Rubinius 1.2.3
